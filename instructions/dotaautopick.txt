For now this code only works if you are playing Dota 2 in 1920x1080 Resolution and Borderless Window Mode.
Pick hero you want to be automatically selected for you once you join a game.
Click 'OK'
Popup Messagebox will appear to verify which hero you picked.
Look for game, join game, as you normally would.
Once at hero selection phase the program will type the hero name you selected and pick it.
It will continue to try to pick it until you finally can click play and the game begins. (2 second delay each try).
If at anytime you want to close the program simply press F8.

1. Copy everything found in here to a text editor (Notepad for example)
2. Save the file as scriptname.ahk (find some clever name so you know what script it is)
3. Make sure you have installed AHK from http://www.autohotkey.com/
4. Right Click the .ahk file you just saved on your computer and Run Script
5. It is optional to Right Click the .ahk file and compile the script
